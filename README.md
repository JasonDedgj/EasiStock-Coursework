Welcome to 
# EasiStock - v3.10.18.15
EasiStock is an easy-to-use Inventory Management System, stylized and targeted towards smaller businesses making an entry into the digital management of stock. This software is part of my Computer Science 2022 Coursework, done in Year 13 of Sixth Form.

EasiStock is made in Python 3.8, using Tkinter SQLite3 and SMTPLib. It has been tested working on Windows 10 and 11. Highlight features include Password Hashing, IP Logging relative to attempted logins, Emailing System, Automatic Button Creation, Adding, Editing, Deleting and creating products, among other features.

## How to Use
EasiStock was made in the hope that it wouldn't be hard to learn, but simply put - Open EasiStock v3.10.18.15.py, the will be a terminal but it will stay in the background whilst you use EasiStock. 

You will need to login, I have set a default user, **USE THE BELOW DETAILS TO LOGIN**
 - Username: 22DefaultUs
 - First Name: Default User
 - Last Name: Ligma
 - Password: password!

## Bugs
To see what bugs are currently known please visit https://github.com/JasonDedgj/EasiStock-Coursework/issues

These bugs will not be fixed unless given a clear solution, to which I will then implement it.

### Particular Acknowledgements
I know that Emailing does not work and is very integral to the program, however it is not something I can easily fix as the whole module is broken due to Google disable the option to use Less-Secure Sign In Tehcnology. To fix this I'd need to use a whole new method of sending emails.

I also know that the code is reaaaaaaallly bad, I have discussed this in detail with my Documentation but in short - This was a very new experience for me, and by the end of this I could see multiple issues, to which I can easily restructure EasiStock Backend in the future, but I will not unless I have time. The code lacks classes and commenting, as will as the disgusting naming converntion, there is data redundancy and it is hard to navigate the code, whilst I have added as much commenting as I can, it is still hard to navigate this code. 

And that is EasiStock, I hope you will enjoy using it, this is my first large scale project so do not expect much, I hope to do more.
